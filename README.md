4-button midi controller for Line6 Helix guitar/bass fx-unit

Made this smaller version of the earlier 6-button midi foot controller for smaller footprint on pedalboard. 

In this version it has two modes, althought only first one is in use. Second one was meant to be for external looper use before I desided go with onboard Boss' RC-3.
Future upcoming upgrades will be led indicators for switches and external tap-tempo feature for occasonal use.
